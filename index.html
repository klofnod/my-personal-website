        <p id="lifeSoFar">I have spent most of my life as a mechanic, I have always enjoyed fixing problems and diagnosing issues. The more I was in mechanics though the more my passion for learing more complex
            systems evolved. Vehicle Computers are an area that lots of mechanics stuggle with and I had my fair share of hard to solve issues. That only drove me to figure out and learn more about the systems
            vehicle manufacturers used for the car computers, which in turn lead me to coding and its prevalence in our every day life. As mechanics has changed alot over the years and a push towards 
            full electric vehicles is inevitable, there will be less work for mechanics and that worries me about my future and job security. The growth of the information sector and the wide variety of 
            potential jobs have me very interested in joining this sector for my career.
